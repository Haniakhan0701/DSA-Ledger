ðŸ“˜ Graph Overview:

A **Graph** is a type of data structure, just like a Tree.
While a **Tree** is a *hierarchical* structure (with a clear parent-child relationship),
a **Graph** is a *non-linear* data structure that can be:

1- Directed or Undirected
2-Weighted or Unweighted
3-Connected or Disconnected
4-Completed Graph

Applications of Graph:
Graphs are more flexible than trees, and can represent real-world systems like:
networks, maps, social connections, and more
All social networking using graph structure like linkedin,facebook,twitter,instagram-logistics 

ðŸ§  Note (from sir's lecture):
"Graph is also a data structure like Tree. Just like Tree is a hierarchical data structure,
Graph can also be hierarchical depending on its structure and direction."
